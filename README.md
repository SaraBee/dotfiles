Making my terminal look exactly the way I want because I'm picky and can never actually remember how I set it up in the first place:

### Setup ###
Run `install.sh`, first off. This will create the symlinks, download vim-plug and install plugins, and for local development, install fonts and iTerm colorscheme.

Since you're trying to replicate my dev setup, you're going to want to
install [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki).

### Make It Look Like Home ##
I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), with the color scheme [Monokai
Soda](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/blob/master/schemes/Monokai%20Soda.itermcolors) and 13pt Inconsolata font. You may need to play with the character spacing a little to get the Powerline glyphs to look good.

### Credit ###
One million years ago, when I was a new vim user, [DeMarko](https://github.com/DeMarko) bequeathed unto
me his vimrc. A lot of the clever stuff in here is from [his
verison](https://github.com/DeMarko/dotvim), and I am also grateful for his
help while I was cleaning it up to remove things I don't actually use!
